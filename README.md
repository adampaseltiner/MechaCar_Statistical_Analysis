## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Based on the multiple linear regression model, the most significant variables which show a non-random effect on the mpg of a MechaCar are the intercept (mpg), vehicle length, and ground clearance.

- The slope of the linear model should not be considered zero, since the p-value of 5.35e-11 is much lower than an the level of significance of 0.05%.
- The linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes rather effectively since the r-squared value of 0.7149 means the predictions are 71% accurate when using this model.

*The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.*

- The overall variance of the production lot is 62.29 PSI, which is well within the 100 PSI variance requirement. However, when looking at the lots individually we see that Lot 1 and Lot 2 fall well under the 100 PSI requirement while Lot 3 is showing a variance of 170.29 which greatly exceeds the allowed variation.
